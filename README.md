README for A.i-Assistant-Open-Source
A.i-Assistant-Open-Source
Welcome to the A.i-Assistant-Open-Source project! This repository contains the code for a Python-based AI assistant developed as a final project for the Harvard CS50 Python course. The assistant integrates various AI modules, APIs, and machine learning models to perform a range of tasks, from voice recognition to sentiment analysis, and is designed to run on a local server.
for this project you will need to register ato various apis links to be able to comunicate with live data , all this instructions for the apis is in this post
APIS FOR A.I ASSISTANT 
as well is necessary install diverse libraries including speech to text which require pyaudio and torch so will need a strong machine 

Features
Voice Recognition: Utilizes pyttsx3 and speech_recognition libraries for text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.
Sentiment Analysis: Implements sentiment analysis using NLTK to interpret and respond to user emotions.
Machine Learning: Employs algorithms like random forests and decision trees using sklearn for data-driven decision-making.
Deep Learning: Integrates advanced models from the transformers library by Hugging Face for language processing tasks.
API Integration: Connects to external AI services and APIs, including WolframAlpha and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, to extend the assistant's capabilities.
Personalization: Implements user profiling to tailor responses and recommendations based on individual preferences.
Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ai-Assistant-Open-Source.git
cd Ai-Assistant-Open-Source
Install Dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Assistant:


python main.py
Usage
The assistant can be run on a local server and accessed via a terminal or command prompt. Interact with the assistant using text commands or prompts. Voice recognition can be enabled, but text-based commands are recommended for consistent performance.
